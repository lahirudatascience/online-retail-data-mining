# üõçÔ∏è Market Basket Analysis on Online Retail Dataset (R Project)

## üìÅ Project Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end analysis pipeline for **Market Basket Analysis** using the **Online Retail Dataset**. The dataset includes transactional data from a UK-based non-store online retailer between **01/12/2010** and **09/12/2011**. The company primarily sells unique all-occasion gifts, with many of its customers being wholesalers.

The project is implemented in **R**, focusing on:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Regional market basket creation
- Applying the **Apriori algorithm**
- Extracting actionable insights
